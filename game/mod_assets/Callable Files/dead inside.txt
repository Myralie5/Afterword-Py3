why am I like this
what did I do
to deserve this hell
with this lens I see through

my footsteps are steady
even if I'm not
every muscle
wound tight like a knot

my mind is detached
from all that I do
subprocesses running
to see the day through

could speak with no thought
on only AI
nobody'd notice
the death in my eyes

brain-dead is my normal
zoned out my often
thoughts gone out rogue
all always forgotten

nobody'd notice
if I just stopped
I keep going in hope
of clues and keys dropped
